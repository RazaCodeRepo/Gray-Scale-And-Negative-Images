# Gray-Scale-And-Negative-Images
This project involved writing a Java software that would take as input different image pictures and convert them into grayscale and negative images as per user requirement. The software involved use of Java's Image Resource library and provides the user with the ability to maniputlate and play around with digital photographs and images.

Details of each of these projects is given below:

Grayscale
Grayscale is the conversion of a colored image into black-and-white. This project allows the user to select multiple pictures and convert them into their gray-scale equivalent. A sample conversion is given below:

Inversion
Inversion refers to the negative of an image. A colored picture's negative has all its colors inverted thus producing an effect where black color becomes white, pink becomes a shade of aqua and so on. A sample conversion is given below:
