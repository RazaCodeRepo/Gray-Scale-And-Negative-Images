# Gray-Scale-And-Negative-Images
This project takes multiple image pictures and converts them into their grayscale or negative equivalent. It comprises of two files: one for grayscale and the other for negative conversion.Both converters make use of the Java Image Resource library.

Details of each of these project is given below:

Grayscale
Grayscale is the conversion of a colored image into black-and-white. This project allows the user to select multiple pictures and convert them into their gray-scale equivalent. A sample conversion is given below:
